Hey,

We would like to thank you for participating in the internship process with us at PSL and for letting us get to know you better. We wanted to inform you that we liked the answers you provided us and we would like to invite you to the next step: showing us your coding skills.

## ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
Today you will be part of one of the most innovative projects at PSL, the SSPE (Seven segments processing engine)  How awesome is that? Your task for today is to parse some text files that your teammates have generated from processing seven segment displays. The files they are generating have the following structure.

```
     _   _       _   _   _   _   _   _  
  |  _|  _| |_| |_  |_    | |_| |_| | | 
  | |_   _|   |  _| |_|   | |_|   | |_| 
```
You must write a program we can run to process any file that has a number encoded like the one above and print a single line with the number represented by this file. In the case of the example, you should print 1234567890.

Note that every number is composed of three lines, every digit has three columns, and the digits are separated by a space.

## WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING? 
1. Use the programming language you like the most, show us all its features and strengths (1000+ extra points if you do it in Brainfuck) 
1. We want a creative solution, we want to learn about you and the things you know 
1. We want a simple and elegant solution, we want to see your best practices when writing code 
1. Please upload your solution to a GitHub private repository and set @ svillegasz and @facevedom as collaborators of the repository. This step is very important since is the only way we will have access to the repository. Remember to add a .gitignore file and use it properly 
1. We want instructions to compile and run your code from a beautiful and powerful command line terminal 
1. If you feel that this problem doesnâ€™t let you show us your whole skill set, please send us a GitHub link to a project that you think will be better and tell us why you think so 
1. Unit testing and a way to run those from the command line terminal will be greatly appreciated
